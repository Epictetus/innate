        <h1>Innate</h1>

<p>Innate is the new core of Ramaze, but useful on its own.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Powerful Helper system</li>
<li>Nodes[1] simply include Innate::Node, so class inheritance is your choice.</li>
<li>The only hard dependency is Rack</li>
<li>Easy to get started</li>
<li>Compatible with major Ruby implementations[2].</li>
<li>Usage of Fiber[3] instead of Thread if possible.</li>
<li>Namespaced serializable configuration system</li>
<li>Simple testing without need of a running server</li>
<li>No clutter in your application directory structure, scales from a single file
upwards</li>
<li>Seamless integration with Rack middleware</li>
<li>No patching[4] of ruby core or stdlib.</li>
<li>Direct access to the current Request, Response, and Session from anywhere via
Trinity</li>
<li>Supporting numerous templating engines.</li>
<li>Any action can be presented in multiple ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>[1]: What you may think of as Controller.
[2]: This includes: Ruby 1.8, Ruby 1.9.1, JRuby, Rubinius
[3]: Fiber is available on 1.9 only at this point.
[4]: However, we add String#each if it isn't there to be compatible with Rack.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>A simple example of using Innate that also shows you how to add your custom
middleware, write specs and the overall concept:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'innate'</span>

<span class='Innate constant id'>Innate</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='setup_middleware identifier id'>setup_middleware</span>

<span class='Innate constant id'>Innate</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='map identifier id'>map</span><span class='lparen token'>(</span><span class='string val'>'/'</span><span class='rparen token'>)</span> <span class='do do kw'>do</span> <span class='bitor op'>|</span><span class='env identifier id'>env</span><span class='bitor op'>|</span>
  <span class='Rack constant id'>Rack</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Response constant id'>Response</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='new identifier id'>new</span><span class='lparen token'>(</span><span class='lbrack token'>[</span><span class='string val'>'Hello, World!'</span><span class='rbrack token'>]</span><span class='rparen token'>)</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='finish identifier id'>finish</span>
<span class='end end kw'>end</span>

<span class='Innate constant id'>Innate</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Mock constant id'>Mock</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='get identifier id'>get</span><span class='lparen token'>(</span><span class='string val'>'/'</span><span class='rparen token'>)</span>
</pre>

<p>And another example, using Node with a normal server:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'innate'</span>

<span class='class class kw'>class</span> <span class='Hi constant id'>Hi</span>
  <span class='include identifier id'>include</span> <span class='Innate constant id'>Innate</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Node constant id'>Node</span>
  <span class='map identifier id'>map</span> <span class='string val'>'/'</span>

  <span class='def def kw'>def</span> <span class='index identifier id'>index</span>
    <span class='string val'>&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
  <span class='end end kw'>end</span>
<span class='end end kw'>end</span>

<span class='Innate constant id'>Innate</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='start identifier id'>start</span> <span class='symbol val'>:adapter</span> <span class='assign token'>=</span><span class='gt op'>&gt;</span> <span class='symbol val'>:mongrel</span>
</pre>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Via git (recommended)</h3>

<p>Installing Innate from git is highly recommended, since it gives you easy
access to alternate branches, bugfixes, and new features.</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='git identifier id'>git</span> <span class='clone identifier id'>clone</span> <span class='git identifier id'>git</span><span class='symbol val'>:/</span><span class='regexp val'>/github.com/</span><span class='manveru identifier id'>manveru</span><span class='div op'>/</span><span class='innate identifier id'>innate</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='git identifier id'>git</span>
</pre>

<p>And add the innate/lib directory to your <code>RUBYLIB</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>For unixish systems you may want to add it to <code>~/.bashrc</code> or the equivalent for
your shell:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='export identifier id'>export</span> <span class='RUBYLIB constant id'>RUBYLIB</span><span class='assign token'>=</span><span class='string val'>&quot;~/path/to/innate/lib:$RUBYLIB&quot;</span>
</pre>

<h3>Via gem install</h3>

<h4>From Github</h4>

<pre class="code"><span class='gem identifier id'>gem</span> <span class='install identifier id'>install</span> <span class='manveru identifier id'>manveru</span><span class='minus op'>-</span><span class='innate identifier id'>innate</span> <span class='minus op'>-</span><span class='minus op'>-</span><span class='source identifier id'>source</span><span class='assign token'>=</span><span class='http identifier id'>http</span><span class='symbol val'>:/</span><span class='regexp val'>/gems.github.com
</span></pre>

<h4>From Rubyforge</h4>

<p>Not yet, and not sure when I'll get around to do this, feel free to ask if you
want to maintain the project at rubyforge.</p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>

<p>First let's see about the good old MVC:</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>Innate doesn't have any ties to models, it does not offer helpers or rake tasks
or whatever you may be expecting, there is no M, use whatever you like.
Innate is, however, known to be compatible with the ORMs listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>ActiveRecord</li>
<li>DataMapper</li>
<li>M4DBI</li>
<li>Og</li>
<li>Sequel</li>
</ul>

<p>Please consider giving us a heads up about what worked for you if it isn't in
the list yet.</p>

<h3>View</h3>

<p>Innate supports multiple templating engines and it is very easy to add your
own.
At the moment we offer following engines out of the box:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://builder.rubyforge.org">Builder</a></li>
<li><a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">Haml</a></li>
<li><a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/sass">Sass</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/erubis">Erubis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/">Tenjin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>How to build your own is discussed at
<a href="http://ramaze.net/HowTo:View">HowTo:View</a>.</p>

<h3>Controller</h3>

<p>Innate follows a different approach than most frameworks, making the controller
subclassing obsolete. To make an object accessible from the outside simply
include Innate::Node and map it to the location you would like.</p>

<h2>Differences from Ramaze</h2>

<p>Innate throws a lot overboard; it doesn't provide all the bells and whistles
that you may be used to.  This makes Ramaze a very good option for larger
applications.</p>

<p>For this reason, Innate won't just be a standalone framework, but will also
become the new core for Ramaze.</p>

<p>Ramaze started out without any of the benefits that Rack gives us these days,
especially regarding the server handlers, request/response, and middleware.</p>

<p>Still it tried to provide everything one might need with the least effort,
leading to a lot of incorporation of dependencies (we have things like bacon,
simple_http, gettext, mime types, ...)</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Configurability has always been a major aspect of Ramaze, and I will keep it
this way. The famous option.rb is the peak of what can be achieved with the
approach of a single Struct for all options, making them approachable from the
CLI, during runtime, on startup, in separate files, even loading from YAML...</p>

<p>What was always missing was a way to add configuration to your own
applications, and extending the Ramaze::Global for this purpose is very
difficult.</p>

<p>With Innate I hope to tackle this problem, it's currently not as fast as
Ramaze::Global, but offers namespaces and inheritance.</p>

<p>The areas wherein Ramaze::Global excels (CLI arguments, documentation and
annotation for options) will soon be integrated as well.</p>

<p>Configuration namespaces will offer a nice way to merge different applications
and reconcile their options in a unified manner, opening the way for slice-like
behaviour.</p>

<p>So for example, one can provide some slice that handles feeds:</p>

<pre class="code"><span class='Innate constant id'>Innate</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Options constant id'>Options</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='for identifier id'>for</span><span class='lparen token'>(</span><span class='symbol val'>:feed_slice</span><span class='rparen token'>)</span> <span class='do do kw'>do</span> <span class='bitor op'>|</span><span class='feed identifier id'>feed</span><span class='bitor op'>|</span>
  <span class='feed identifier id'>feed</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='map identifier id'>map</span> <span class='assign token'>=</span> <span class='string val'>'/feeds'</span>
  <span class='feed identifier id'>feed</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='view_root identifier id'>view_root</span> <span class='assign token'>=</span> <span class='string val'>'slice/feed/view'</span>
  <span class='feed identifier id'>feed</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='retrieve identifier id'>retrieve</span> <span class='assign token'>=</span> <span class='lambda identifier id'>lambda</span><span class='lbrace token'>{</span> <span class='Post constant id'>Post</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='all identifier id'>all</span> <span class='rbrace token'>}</span>
<span class='end end kw'>end</span>

<span class='class class kw'>class</span> <span class='Feeds constant id'>Feeds</span>
  <span class='include identifier id'>include</span> <span class='Innate constant id'>Innate</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Node constant id'>Node</span>
  <span class='options identifier id'>options</span> <span class='symbol val'>:feed_slice</span>
<span class='end end kw'>end</span>
</pre>

<p>It would be a requirement to set the options before requiring the slice itself,
but that's just a minor issue that I think we can live with.</p>

<h3>Controller</h3>

<p>Well, that's the part I worry most about. Every existing Ramaze application
relies on the Ramaze::Controller.</p>

<p>The major question is, should we switch Ramaze entirely to the Node approach or
maybe just provide a Ramaze::Controller that has Innate::Node included?</p>

<p>It does have drawbacks, such as decreased support for either approach, but
might give people a familiar anchor when switching, and allow them to gradually
adjust their applications.</p>

<p>Other things are layouts and provides.</p>

<h4>Layouts</h4>

<p>Since layouts were an afterthought in Ramaze, they were made normal actions
like every other on the respective controllers, leading to lots of confusion
over the correct way to use layouts, the Controller::layout syntax in respect
to the real location of layouts, how to exclude/include single actions, where
layouts should be stored, how to prevent lookup from external requests, ...</p>

<p>I made layouts just as important as views and methods for the Action in Innate,
and they have their own root directory to live in and will not be considered as
a normal view template, so they cannot be accidentally be rendered as their own
actions.</p>

<p>This strikes me as important, because I consider layouts to be superior to
Ezamar elements and equal to render<em>partial or render</em>template, just about
every application uses it, so they should be handled in the best way possible.</p>

<p>The root directory for layouts is in line with the other default locations:</p>

<p>/node
/layout
/view
/model
/public</p>

<p>While none of these directories is necessary, they will be the default
locations and should be included in a new proto for Ramaze.</p>

<p>Innate will not have project generating capabilities, so we just have to
document it very well and provide some example apps.</p>

<h4>Provides</h4>

<p>This is a major new feature stolen from Merb and adapted for the ease of use of
Innate/Ramaze.
It won't have all the capabilities one might be used to out of the box, but
extending them is easy.</p>

<p>Having "provides" means that every Action has different ways of being rendered,
depending on so-called wishes.</p>

<p>A wish may be anything related to the request object, and by default it will
trigger on the filename extension asked for.
This enables you to create a single action that can be rendered in
json/rss/atom/yaml/xml/xhtml/html/wap or different languages...</p>

<p>The dispatching in Node depends on the filename extension by default, but more
decision paths can be added to Action by overriding some defaults.</p>

<p>There is no convention yet of how layouts will map to these wishes, but I hope
to specify this further once we have some specific requirements.</p>

<p>This feature is very alien to Ramaze, which always has a 1:1 mapping between
actions and their views and how they are rendered, which made people wonder how
to serve sass as css or how to respond with json for a ajax request until they
finally were pointed to setting content-type, using respond and setting up
custom routes.</p>

<p>I hope that adding this feature will make things simpler for people who care
about it while it can be ignored by people who don't.</p>

<h3>More specifics</h3>

<p>Here I try to list the most important things that Ramaze will offer but that
are not included in Innate itself in terms of globs:</p>

<ul>
<li>cache.rb and cache/*.rb</li>
<li>current/response.rb</li>
<li>tool/{create,mime,localize,daemonize,record,project_creator}.rb</li>
<li>spec/helper/*.rb</li>
<li>snippets/*<em>/</em>.rb</li>
<li>gestalt.rb</li>
<li>store/default.rb</li>
<li>contrib.rb or any contribs</li>
<li>adapter/*.rb (superseded by a lightweight adapter.rb)</li>
<li>template/ezamar<em>/</em></li>
<li>bacon.rb</li>
<li>dispatcher.rb</li>
<li>dispatcher/*.rb</li>
</ul>

<p>There might be a couple of things I've forgotten, but that's what a quick
glance tells me.</p>

<p>Let's go through them one by one and consider what's gonna happen to them:</p>

<h3>Cache</h3>

<p>Caching is a very important concern and one of the most difficult things to get
right for any web application.  Ramaze tried to get caching done right and I
consider it fairly successful when it comes to that.  There are a myriad of
options available for caching, different caching mechanisms such as marshal to
filesystem, memcached, in-memory, yaml to filesystem, etc.  The granularity can
be chosen depending on the use case, distributed caching of sessions, actions,
single key/value pairs, and so on.  Fine-tuning each of those to use a different
mechanism will be made as painless as possible.</p>

<p>We have gone through a lot of difficulties, memory-leaks, disputes, and
challenges to get this done, but most users won't realize this until they
encounter a problem.</p>

<p>At this point I would really like to thank all of the people who contributed to
caching as it is today.</p>

<p>I will move caching in a lighter form to Innate, mostly what is needed for
distributed sessions, giving Ramaze the opportunity to add new kinds.</p>

<h3>Response</h3>

<p>This was always a very little class since Rack started providing more features,
I think it's time to retire it and lobby for integration of features into Rack
itself.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>Ramaze acquired quite a lot of tools, some of those are not useful anymore,
other ones might have to stick around.</p>

<h4>Tool::Create</h4>

<p>This has been used by <code>bin/ramaze --create</code> and I think it will stick around
for some more time.</p>

<h4>Tool::ProjectCreator</h4>

<p>Dependency for Tool::Create, should get a lot more documentation and exposure
because I think it can be very useful for sharing and creating basic
application skeletons.
Another route would be to find a better tool and make it a dependency for
<code>ramaze --create</code>, but that would give a terrible out-of-the-box experience.</p>

<h5>Tool::Daemonize</h5>

<p>Nothing but issues with this one although it is just a very thin wrapper for
the daemons gem. Nobody has contributed to this so far despite the issues and
it seems that there are a lot of different solutions for this problem.
This will be removed from both Ramaze and Innate.</p>

<h5>Ramaze::Record</h5>

<p>Well, this might be the most obvious candidate for removal, maybe it can be
revived as middleware.  The functionality itself is in the adapter and even
that's only a few lines.  But so far I have never seen any usage for it.</p>

<h5>Tool::Localize</h5>

<p>I and a lot of other people have used this over time and it has proven itself
to be a very easy and straight-forward way of doing localization.</p>

<p>It think it is better suited as middleware which can be included into
rack-contrib and doesn't rely on the normal session but a simple unobfuscated
cookie.</p>

<h5>Tool::MIME</h5>

<p>This one will be removed, Rack::Mime is a viable alternative.</p>

<h3>Spec helpers</h3>

<p>Over the years, Ramaze has collected a wide variety of spec helpers that are
not really compatible to each other and rely on real request/response with a
running server.</p>

<p>Innate provides a better alternative via Innate::Mock for its own specs,
applications will need the power of a real scraping library and we will provide
a canonical way of running a server in the background before running the specs.
There will not be any other helpers in Innate, but Ramaze might provide a few
standard ones to get up and running (hpricot, rexml).</p>

<p>Regarding the spec output parsers, that's a different issue.  Providing
readable output while running specs is a major feature that must be included in
order to keep frustration low.  We will provide a suitable logger replacement
so one can simply extend Bacon with that in order to get nice summaries and
good error output.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>

<p>Snippets have been in Ramaze since day 1, but I think it is wrong for Innate to
provide those. Over the years there have been lots of libraries that all
provide their own core extensions and interference is a major issue. Innate
will keep everything as clean as possible, doing subclasses inside the Innate
namespace where it needs to change things.</p>

<p>Two things that we need are (currently) String#each, because Rack relies on it,
and BasicObject as superclass for the Option class. They are only applied on
demand.</p>

<p>These are in the directory called core_extensions, to make it very, very clear
what we are doing and how we are doing it.</p>

<p>Ramaze has still a lot of these snippets and will continue to, although I will
constantly strive to reduce them slowly.</p>

<h3>Gestalt</h3>

<p>Gestalt has been the first "templating_engine" for Ramaze and is still used in
some fractions of the code and various applications.  There are a lot of other
html/xml builders out there these days so I think this is no good choice for
inclusion into Innate. I will keep it inside Ramaze.</p>

<h3>Ramaze::Store::Default</h3>

<p>I will remove this class from both Innate and Ramaze. It started out as a
simple wrapper for YAML::Store to make the tutorial easier, but I think it
gives a wrong impression of being anything else.</p>

<p>It's very slow, might raise exceptions under heavy load and a plain YAML::Store
or PStore or any other persistence mechanism is generally a better choice, so
there is no need to keep this around.</p>

<h3>Contrib</h3>

<p>There's a lot in there, and some of these things are used widely, others not at
all.  Some things are better suited as middleware, I will move them to
rack-contrib ASAP:</p>

<ul>
<li>gzip_filter</li>
<li>profiling</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there's things that don't see much use.  They should stay in the future
Ramaze contrib or face removal:</p>

<ul>
<li>facebook</li>
<li>gettext</li>
<li>maruku_uv</li>
<li>sequel_cache</li>
<li>rest</li>
</ul>

<p>And other things that should be moved into Ramaze proper:</p>

<ul>
<li>email</li>
<li>file_cache (done)</li>
<li>gems</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these will be included in Innate.</p>

<h3>Adapters</h3>

<p>These are entirely the responsibility of Rack/Innate now, Ramaze doesn't need
to worry about that.  WEBrick will remain the default adapter since it is in
the Ruby stdlib.</p>

<h3>Templating</h3>

<p>Templating will also be handled by Innate for the most part.</p>

<h4>Ezamar</h4>

<p>I have plans to make Ezamar a separate project.  It's been stable since over a
year and I think it's time to make it available for other projects.  ERB will
be the new default engine since it also is in the stdlib.</p>

<h3>Bacon</h3>

<p>Bacon will be a dependency for Ramaze and Innate specs, but we will not ship it
anymore, it's stable and has all features we need included in the release.</p>

<h3>Dispatcher</h3>

<p>Innate uses a stripped down version of the Ramaze dispatcher.  The Ramaze
dispatcher was strongly influenced by Nitro, but proved to be a difficult
part.  We are now using Rack's URLMap directly, and have a minimal dispatching
mechanism directly in Node (like we used to have one in Controller).</p>

<p>A lot of the functionality that used to be in the different dispatchers is now
provided by Rack middleware.</p>

<p>The Dispatcher itself isn't needed anymore.  It used to setup
Request/Response/Session, which was superseded by Current, this again is now
superseded by STATE::wrap.</p>

<p>We are going to remove all the other dispatchers as well, providing default
ways to provide the same functionality, and various middleware to use.</p>

<h4>Dispatcher::Action</h4>

<p>This dispatcher was used to initiate the controller dispatching, this is now
not needed anymore.</p>

<h4>Dispatcher::Directory</h4>

<p>This will also be removed.  There is a directory listing middleware already.</p>

<h4>Dispatcher::Error</h4>

<p>There's middleware for this as well, and a canonical way of routing errors to
other actions.  This used to be one of the most difficult parts of Ramaze and
it will be removed to make things simpler.</p>

<h4>Dispatcher::File</h4>

<p>This is a combination of the etag and conditionalget middlewares, ergo Innate
and Ramaze will not serve static files themselves anymore, but leave the job to
Rack or external servers.</p>
